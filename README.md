# FAST API COURSE

This application is just a simple CRUD API to get more knowledge about [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

## TODO

- Reorganize the code to use Clean Architecture (or Domain Drive Design?)
- Split environments (dev, prod)
- Use Postgres as a DB
- Build docker-compose to use containers for these services
